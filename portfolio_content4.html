              <p id="port4info">In a visualisation class, we were tasked with imitating the design of a magazine cover and make our own while using a specific tone of voice. <br> To appeal to people who love music and art, I decided the tone of voice should be very artistic and with a dedication to style. I chose these images of singer Lorde because they're very stylized and artistic and both have a very "aged" look. <br>I wanted the text to match the photos behind it, so the artistic and "aged" feel was translated all the way from the Serif font to the Billboard Logo, which has been distorted slightly at the edges.</p>
